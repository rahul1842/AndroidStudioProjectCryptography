# 🔐 Android Encryption App

This Android application demonstrates three fundamental cryptographic techniques: **RSA Encryption**, **Rail Fence Cipher**, and **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**. It is designed for learning purposes and showcases how data can be encrypted, decrypted, and securely exchanged using different algorithms within a mobile environment.

## 📱 Features

- 🔐 **RSA Encryption & Decryption**
  - Enter two prime numbers to generate keys.
  - Encrypt and decrypt numeric messages using RSA.
  
- 🪢 **Rail Fence Cipher**
  - Simple transposition cipher.
  - Encrypt and decrypt plain text based on the number of rails.
  
- 🔑 **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**
  - Simulates secure key exchange over a public channel.
  - Users input public prime and primitive root.

- 🎨 Simple and user-friendly interface using Android XML layouts.
- 💡 Educational tool for understanding encryption methods.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** – For implementing cryptographic logic.
- **XML** – For designing the app UI.
- **Android Studio** – Development environment.
